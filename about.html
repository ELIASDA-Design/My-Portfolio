                Although my <strong>Bachelor Degree</strong> was somehow different than IT, <br> but my love to the programming began for the first time <br> we had studied the first topic in <strong>C++</strong>.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center about-text">
                We dived deep into <strong>Assembly</strong> language, then <strong>PLC</strong> and <strong>Java</strong>
                <br> and the final was in <strong>Algorithms and Data Structures.</strong> <br> it was my last <strong>high
                score</strong> subject in my whole university life. <br>
            </p>
            <p class="text-center about-text">
                I got my first job in <strong>Telecommunications</strong> as Maintenance Engineer in the <br> biggest Communications Company in my country, but although it was good <br> I was still thinking in
                <strong>changing</strong> my whole <br> <strong>career path</strong> as fast as the chance comes to me. <br>
            </p>
            <p class="text-center about-text">
                On the first day of <strong>COVID-19 Quarantine</strong>, I began my learning journey. <br> I
                <strong>began</strong> my <strong>learning</strong> path as a <strong>Web Developer</strong> using
                <strong>Coursera</strong> Platform. <br> I took courses in <strong>HTML, CSS, JS,</strong> and
                <strong>Bootstrap</strong> and many, <strong>many topics</strong>
                <br> related to that field. And also began practicing that on different <br> websites using
                <strong>Git</strong> and <strong>GitHub</strong>.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center about-text">
                This <strong>big step</strong> in my life led me to <strong>change</strong> my <strong>career</strong> path and began <br> <strong>my new job as a DevOps Engineer</strong> in my same company. And although I got my dream job, <br> but <strong>I never stopped learning</strong>                any new topic or technology or anything <br> I feel it totally new for me, and that gave me a big push to get <br> into any new challenge regardless the difficulties.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center about-text">
                <strong>Honestly</strong>, I'm not that super hero who can finish a website or a program in two <br> or three hours, but <strong>I'm totally sure</strong> that you will find a <strong>person who never say no, and
                he will do it.</strong><br>
            </p>
            <p class="text-center about-text">
                Really, I <strong>totally believe</strong> that things are so hard at the beginning, but it will <br>
                <strong>never</strong> be the same by the time you <strong>go ahead</strong> and <strong>work hard</strong> and <strong>learn more and more.</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="text-center about-text">
                Finally, I hope you will find the real person whom you came in to get your work done. <br> Take your time and visit the links, and I'm sure you will be satisfied.
